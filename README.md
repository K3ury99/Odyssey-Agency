# Odyssey-Agency 🍃
> [!TIP]
> This is a design I made for a project, it's made in Mockitt one of the hundreds of interface editing applications currently available, it's inspired by a travel agency where it tries to convey the vibe of traveling around the world with a simple click, I hope you like it.
